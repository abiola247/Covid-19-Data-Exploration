### Dataset:
The dataset consists of two Microsoft Excel files: one named "CovidDeaths" and the other "CovidVaccinations". These files contain comprehensive global data on COVID-19 death statistics and vaccination progress.

### Questions Answered:
Using SQL exploration techniques, the following key COVID-19 related questions were analyzed and answered:

- What is the percentage death rate across different locations and continents?
- What percentage of the population has been infected with COVID-19?
- Which countries have the highest infection rates relative to their populations?
- Which continents have the highest death counts?
- Which countries have the highest total death counts?
- How many people in total have been vaccinated against COVID-19?
- What is the percentage of the population vaccinated in each location?
